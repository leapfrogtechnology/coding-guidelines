#### What is Typescript?

Typescript is just a Superset of Javascript that brings additional features to javascript. It cannot be compiled by browser or any javascript compiler. It has its own compiler that converts typescript codes to acceptable javascript code.

#### Installing and using Typescript?

Use node to install Typescript globally,

`npm install typescript â€“g`

And that's all which is required to set up a compiler. Now we can use `tsc` command to transpile typescript code to javascript. Start creating a typescript file and write your javascript code to check what typescript compiler has to say about it. Use the following to compile to javascript that could be run by node or browser.

`Tsc fileName`

This will generate an equivalent Js code.
