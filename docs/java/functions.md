#### The following convention should be followed for `function` naming:

* Method names should contain a verb, as they are used to make an object take action. They should be mixed case, beginning with a lowercase letter, and the first letter of each subsequent word should be capitalized. Adjectives and nouns may be included in method names:

### verb
```
public int calculateRemainingLeaves() {

    //implementation

} 
```

### verb and noun

```
public String getFullName() {
    
    //implementation
}
