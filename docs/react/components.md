#### The following convention should be followed for components naming:

* `PascalCase` should be used to name the component file.
* Name of the component should match the filename 
  ** It should be understandable by everyone (no EntityForListItem)
  ** it should be simple to use (no SimpleBeanFactoryAwareAspectInstanceFactory)
