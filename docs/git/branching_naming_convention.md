#### The following convention should be followed:

* Branch name should exactly match with the corresponding JIRA ticket that you will be working on. `<project-name>-<ticket-number>`
     
   Examples:

          * FHF-100
          * DEL-200

* If there's no JIRA or project management tool in use, the branch naming strategy should be feature specific. 

   Examples: 
           * upgrade-php 
           * add-button-tooltip
